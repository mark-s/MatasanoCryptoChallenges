My solutions to 'The Matasano Crypto Challenges'

>> [...] a collection of 48 exercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto.
This is a different way to learn about crypto than taking a class or reading a book.
We give you problems to solve. They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems
and modern cryptographic constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the 
underlying crypto concepts yourself. When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a 
good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked.
