They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems\r\n> and modern cryptographic constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the \r\n> underlying crypto concepts yourself. When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a \r\n> good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked.\r\n\r\n\r\n### See for more info:\r\n\r\n[http://cryptopals.com/](http://cryptopals.com/)\r\n\r\n[https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/](https://blog.pinboard.in/2013/04/the_matasano_crypto_challenges/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
